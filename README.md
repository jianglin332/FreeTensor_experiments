# Experiments on FreeTensor

Example applications and micro-benchmarks on [FreeTensor](https://github.com/roastduck/FreeTensor). Some of them are work in progress (experiments are experimental).

Evaluation code in the paper *FreeTensor: A Free-Form DSL with Holistic Optimizations for Irregular Tensor Programs* can be found here. This repository uses a later version of FreeTensor. To reproduce the exact result of the paper please consider the Artifact Evaluation version of FreeTensor, published [here](https://zenodo.org/record/6327595).
